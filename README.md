# SITP IoT

This project simulates a decentralized IoT system. It measures time between stations on a route, letting city users know their exact location without relying on GPS sensors. The key is quick peer-to-peer communication among IoT nodes, making location tracking simpler, faster and cheaper for everyone.

A demo with the results of the simulation is shown in this [video](https://youtu.be/Tv7xbcGWVfc)
